This project could not have happened if it was not for David Woolbright and his book, "The Big Blue Assembler Book".  Mr. Woolbright has graciously 
given permission to use his book for training data.  His book is also helpful to developer's who want a gentle introducton to the topic.  Its available on amazon [here](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Blue-Assembler-Book/dp/B0BLKWD3WD/ref%253Dsr_1_1?crid%253D1DTWV66PRJIAA%2526keywords%253Dbig%252Bblue%252Bbook%252Bof%252Bassembler%2526qid%253D1699535915%2526sprefix%253Dbig%252Bblue%252Bbook%252Bof%252Bassembler%252Caps%252C84%2526sr%253D8-1).
